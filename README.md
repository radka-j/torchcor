# TorchCor
TorchCor is a high-performance Python library for cardiac electrophysiology (CEP) simulations using the finite element method (FEM) on general-purpose GPUs. Built on top of PyTorch, TorchCor provides significant computational acceleration for CEP simulations, particularly with large mesh inputs.
