when dx and dy is too small, the conjugate gradient does not converge.
For instances, when dx=dy=0.1, it converges. But it does not when dx=dy=0.01.
Because thermal diffusivity is too large. dt should be smaller

The smaller the thermal diffusivity, the less number of iteration it takes to converge.

Are the non-zeros in mass and stiffness matrix always at the same location?
Now, we have the reverse_cuthill_mckee permutation, how to make use of it?
